Simulations and stuff - Vincent Beffara <vbeffara@ens-lyon.fr>


1. Compilation

I am using the very nice SCons framework for my simulations, because
it has a lot of cool features (such as object file cache, automatic
dependency tracking, and most of all portability). It is very easy to
install, if you already have Python; once it is done, just type 'scons'
in the main directory.

If you can't or won't install SCons, you can still compile everything by
hand: for instance, by saying (in the top directory where this README
file is, and assuming you have SDL installed):

      g++ -Ilibvb/ -O3 $(sdl-config --cflags --libs) -o 2D/SLE 2D/SLE.cpp


2. Some notes about the 'libvb' library

The directory libvb/ contains a small library providing very easy
display and EPS output for 2D simulations (in greyscale). It is entirely
composed of header files, so compilation should be very easy. The only
dependency is on SDL (though that might change - but the interface
itself will not).

At some point I will implement a way of compiling without SDL (while
keeping all the convenient helper functions and EPS generation) through
CPP defines; this will help especially on Windows.

Up-to-date documentation on the library is at the following webpage:

3. About the 'xtoys' directory:

These programs are not mine at all, they were written by Michael Creutz
(see the webpage at http://thy.phy.bnl.gov/www/xtoys/xtoys.html). I
include them because they are somehow related to the others, and because
I had to rewrite the Makefile to compile them on Mac OS X, now they
should compile everywhere (as long as the X11 include files are present,
of course).

If there is any legal problem about their presence here, I will remove
them at once.


Have fun.
