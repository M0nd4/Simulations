For info about compiling and running the programs, see the INSTALL file.

For  info about  running everything  under MS  Windows, see  the windows
directory.

Some notes about the 'libvb' library:
-------------------------------------------

The  directory 'libvb'  contains a  very  simple library  to display  2D
graphics on the screen  and to export EPS files. It is  very easy to use
(cf. the documentation that will appear "soon").

To have  it actually display  stuff on the  screen, you need  either SDL
development libraries, or X11 development libraries. You can disable any
(or both) at configure time; by  default, libvb uses SDL if present, and
X11 if SDL is  absent -- or none if none is  present, which disables the
display but not the EPS output.

A  note about  performance:  The  choice of  driver  will influence  the
running time, and depending on your  platform the one you should use can
be different.   Some tests (dummy =  no driver), time in  seconds to run
"Ising .88  300" (this is  "user" time, total  running time seems  to be
even more in favor of SDL):

About the 'xtoys' directory:
----------------------------

These programs are not mine at  all, they were written by Michael Creutz
(see  the  webpage  at  http://thy.phy.bnl.gov/www/xtoys/xtoys.html).  I
include them because they are somehow related to the others, and because
I had  to rewrite the  Makefile to  compile them on  Mac OS X,  now they
should compile everywhere (as long as the X11 include files are present,
of course).

If there is  any legal problem about their presence  here, I will remove
them at once.


Have fun.
