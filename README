0. Executive summary

Compile typing 'tools/waf' (or just 'waf' if you have it somewhere in 
your $PATH). Don't forget to add build/default/libvb to your 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable if necessary.


1. Compilation

I am using the very nice waf framework for my simulations, because it 
has a lot of cool features (such as automatic dependency tracking, and 
most of all portability). It is very easy to install, if you already 
have Python, because it is a single file; there is a copy in the tools/ 
directory, which you can copy somewhere in your $PATH for convenience 
(somewhere where you have write privileges while running it), or use 
directly.


2. Some notes about the 'libvb' library

The directory libvb/ contains a small library providing very easy 
display and PNG output for 2D simulations, plus convenience classes for 
simulations.  Up-to-date documentation on the library is at the 
above-mentioned web page.  It uses a few outside libraries:

- Cairo [mandatory] : for internally drawing objects (via CairoMM)

- FLTK  [optional]  : for graphical display 


3. About the 'xtoys' directory:

These programs are not mine at all, they were written by Michael Creutz 
(see the web page at http://thy.phy.bnl.gov/www/xtoys/xtoys.html). I 
include them because they are somehow related to the others, and because 
I had to rewrite the Makefile to compile them on Mac OS X, now they 
should compile everywhere (as long as the X11 include files are present, 
of course).

If there is any legal problem about their presence here, I will remove 
them at once.
