1. Compilation

I am using the very nice SCons framework for my simulations, because
it has a lot of cool features (such as object file cache, automatic
dependency tracking, and most of all portability). It is very easy to
install, if you already have Python; once it is done, just type 'scons'
in the main directory.

If you don't have SCons installed, for convenience there is one in the 
tools/ directory. You can untar it there and then, from the top 
directory, run it by typing 'python tools/scons.py'. This is what the 
included Makefile does, so you can actually type 'make' instead.

2. Some notes about the 'libvb' library

The directory libvb/ contains a small library providing very easy
display and EPS output for 2D simulations (in greyscale). It is entirely
composed of header files, so compilation should be very easy.

Up-to-date documentation on the library is at the following webpage:

      http://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/~vbeffara/libvb/

It uses a few outside libraries if they are present (but most of the 
code will still compile and work without it):

- FLTK for graphical display

- GMP for high-precision computations (in the vb::real type - which is 
  simply an alias for double if GMP is absent)

- Boost for a few graph-related algorithms.


3. About the 'xtoys' directory:

These programs are not mine at all, they were written by Michael Creutz
(see the webpage at http://thy.phy.bnl.gov/www/xtoys/xtoys.html). I
include them because they are somehow related to the others, and because
I had to rewrite the Makefile to compile them on Mac OS X, now they
should compile everywhere (as long as the X11 include files are present,
of course).

If there is any legal problem about their presence here, I will remove
them at once.


Have fun.
