* 1D/BiTree

The idea is that adding dub-trees of different (lower) branching should
exhibit interesting phenomena at the "second critical point".

| n | m |  d |    a | drift | remarks                            |
|---+---+----+------+-------+------------------------------------|
| 3 | 0 |  5 |   .4 |  .091 | defaults                           |

| 3 | 2 |  5 |  .35 |  .071 | a barely super for base tree       |
| 3 | 2 |  5 |  .32 |  .039 | barely sub-critical for base       |
| 3 | 2 |  5 |  .49 |  .192 | barely sub-critical for additional |
| 3 | 2 |  5 |  .51 |  .206 | super-critical for both            |
