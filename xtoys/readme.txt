The xtoys package includes sources for:

 xising         a two dimensional Ising model simulator
 xpotts         for the two dimensional Potts model
 xautomalab     a totalistic cellular automaton simulator
 xsand          for the Bak, Tang, Wiesenfeld sandpile model
 xfires         a simple forest fire automaton
 schrodinger    a schrodinger equation simulator
 xwaves         shows three different wave equations
 xtoys.tar      all the files combined
 
For some of these there is a corresponding .txt readme file.

To compile after unpacking, first type "make". If this does not work,
try the hints in Makefile.

These all look best on a color monitor.

I want these to compile under generic X; so if you have problems on
any machine supporting X, I would appreciate knowing so I can fix
things.

The latest versions are kept at http://thy.phy.bnl.gov/www/xtoys.html
