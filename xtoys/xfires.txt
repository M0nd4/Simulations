 This program simulates forest fires.
 
 On each site of a lattice is either 
 nothing, a tree, or a fire.
 In one time step a fire spreads to 
 adjacent trees and leaves an
 empty space.  Trees are born 
 in a random matter with a probability
 of approximately 1/32 per time step.
 If no fires are active, one is 
 started at a random location.  Fires 
 can also be started with the 
 mouse button. 


An Amiga version of this program  was 
published in the Dec. 1993 issue of 
Jumpdisk.  

This program is freely distributable.
